# SmartTrash â€“ Intelligent Waste Bin System

This project offers a complete intelligent waste management solution, composed of three main parts:  
- **[Embedded Electronics (ESP32)](https://github.com/boujnan03/SmartWaste-Management/tree/main/smartTrash_arduino)**
- **[Server/API (FastAPI + MongoDB + Firebase RTDB)](https://github.com/boujnan03/SmartWaste-Management/tree/main/smartTrash_API)**
- **[Mobile Application (Flutter)](https://github.com/boujnan03/SmartWaste-Management/tree/main/smartTrash_flutter/smart_trash)**

It allows real-time measurement and monitoring of fill level, weight, humidity, temperature, water presence, and gas in the trash bin, with local display and data transmission to a user interface.

---

## 1. Electronics Part (ESP32)

### Main Features
- Fill level measurement (ultrasonic)
- Weight measurement (HX711)
- Temperature and humidity (DHT11)
- Gas detection (MQ-2 or similar)
- Water detection (analog sensor)
- Automatic lid opening (servo)
- Sound alert (buzzer)
- Local display (I2C LCD)
- Periodic data transmission to server via WiFi

## 2. Server / API Part (FastAPI + MongoDB + Firebase RTDB)

### Main Features
- Reception of data sent by ESP32 (POST JSON)
- Data storage in MongoDB (history, statistics)
- Real-time synchronization with Firebase Realtime Database (for Flutter application)
- REST API provision for the application (consultation, statistics, alerts)
- Authentication (optional)
- Multi-bin management (optional)

### Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Python [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- **Database:** [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- **Real-time:** [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database)

### API Endpoint Example
```
POST /update/trash_1
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "bin_id": "trash_1",
  "gaz_level": 5,
  "humidity": 45.2,
  "temperature": 23.1,
  "location": {"latitude": 32.376553, "longitude": -6.320284},
  "name": "Bin 1 - Lobby",
  "trash_level": 80,
  "trash_type": "plastic",
  "weight": 2.5,
  "volume": 100,
  "water_level": 60
}
```

### Main Files:  
- `smartTrash_API/main.py` (FastAPI)
- `smartTrash_API/requirements.txt`
- MongoDB and Firebase configuration in the `smartTrash_API/` folder

---

## 3. Mobile Application Part (Flutter)

### Main Features
- Real-time visualization of each bin's data (via Firebase RTDB)
- Location mapping
- Alerts (full bin, water leak, gas detected...)
- Statistics and history
- User authentication (optional)

### Technologies Used
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Firebase RTDB](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database)
- For mapping:
  - [flutter_osm_plugin (OpenStreetMap)](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_osm_plugin) **(open source, recommended)**
  - or [Google Maps Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter)
- [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) or [Bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/) for state management

### Main Files:  
- `smartTrash_flutter/smart_trash/` (Flutter application folder)
- `smartTrash_flutter/smart_trash/lib/` (Dart sources)

- Adapt the WiFi SSID/password and server URL in the code
- Connect the sensors according to the diagram

### 2. Server Part
- Install Python dependencies:  
  ```bash
  cd server
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Launch the server:  
  ```bash
  uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```
- Ensure MongoDB and Firebase are configured and accessible

### 3. Flutter Application Part
